# CodeNoteApp

A lightweight app inspired by Apple Notes made for jotting down notes about code
* __Never__ formats or autocorrects your text. E.g. changing ' to â€˜ like many note apps do
* Advanced code blocks with optional syntax highlighting: hover over the top right corner of a code block to turn on syntax highlighting
* 100% locally stored notes
* Lightweight footprint thanks to Tauri and Svelte
